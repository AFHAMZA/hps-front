            "Ahmed Hamza is an aerospace engineer, former military R&D officer,
            and the visionary founder of HPS Aviation. With over a decade of
            experience in missile mechanics and propulsion systems at the
            Egyptian Armed Forces Research Center, Ahmed specialized in
            developing high-performance propulsion technologies under extreme
            precision and operational demands."

            In 2014, inspired by the flight of hummingbirds, he began exploring
            a new concept for aerial propulsion — one that would break the
            limitations of current eVTOL technologies. After years of intensive
            research, prototyping, and simulation using tools like MATLAB,
            ANSYS, and CFD, he created the Humming Propulsion System (HPS) — a
            compact, efficient, and tilt-free propulsion technology capable of
            revolutionizing how we fly.

          <p class="text-slate-300">
            Today, Ahmed leads HPS Aviation from Abu Dhabi Global Market,
            building not only the propulsion system of the future, but also its
            first product: CROW, a hydrogen-powered flying car that makes the
            dream of true personal air mobility a reality.
